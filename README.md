# Simutrans Deploy

This repository contains deployment scripts used for updating Simutrans (nightly) on:

1) AUR (Arch Linux User Repository) 
2) Steam

Both currently ship nightly releases of Simutrans Standard and Simutrans Extended (along with pak128.britain-ex). Take in mind that you will need to be maintainer or have access to the simutransbuild Steam account to make use of the script.

I've made them public in case I suddenly disappear, I lose my copies, or if anyone want to help improving the process.
