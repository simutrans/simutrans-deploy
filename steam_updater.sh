# Usage: steam_updater "steam_password"
#
# Interactive script to update Steam repositories of Simutrans
# 1) You will be asked for pakset
# 2) Pakset will be downloaded and unzipped 
# 3) You will be asked for the branch to use
#
# The default branch is NOT available, because it can only be updated manually at:
#
# https://partner.steamgames.com/apps/builds/434520
#
# However for ease of use you can upload to the current point release branch, then merge it with the default branch
#
# If you want to upload to a new branch, first you need to create it from Steamworks.
# 
# Â¡Downloads URLs need to be updated manually in this script!
